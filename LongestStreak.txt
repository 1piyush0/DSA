Imagine you're given a bag of numbered tiles that are randomly numbered, and your task is to arrange these tiles in a way that forms the longest possible chain of consecutive numbers.
Some numbers may be repeated or missing, but each number can only be used once in the chain.
Your objective is to determine the length of this longest chain of consecutive numbers.
 
Example 1:
Input: n=6 tiles = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: Arranging the tiles as [1, 2, 3, 4] forms the longest chain of consecutive numbers with a length of 4.
 
Example 2:
Input: n=10 tiles = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
 
Constraints:
The number of tiles, n, is such that 0 <= n <= 10^5.
Each tile's number will be an integer in the range from -10^9 to 10^9.
